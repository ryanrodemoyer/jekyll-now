I'm a growth-minded individual with a heavy emphasis on software development and source control ideas and technologies.

### More Information

By day, I am a gainfully employed full stack software developer specializing in leadership, human-to-human interactions, source control methodologies (primarily using distribution source control systems) and focusing on C#, Microsoft SQL Server, Angular and Typescript. 

Recent explorations outside of my comfort zone include learning Python, building a personal brand, screencasting and formalizing a framework for onboarding developers new to Git.
